# 2. Capstone Project 1 - Customer Segmentation of Retail Customers :
        In Retail and E-Commerce (B2C), and more broadly in B2B, one of the key elements shaping the business strategy of a firm would be understanding of customer behaviour. More specifically, understanding their customers based on different business metrics: how much they spend (revenue), how often they spend (frequency), are they new or existing customers, what are their favorite products, etc... Such understanding would in turn help direct marketing, sales, account management and product teams to support better this customer and improve the product offering.The objective of this project has been to Identify customer segments based on the overall buying behaviour of the Client.
